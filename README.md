# Homework2.1
This project was challenging. Who likes writing bio's? I wanted to create something simple, clean and easy on the eyes. 
I think the salmon color was appealing to the eyes and didn't require much complimenting other than a white background
or white font color. I tried to incorporate a "sticky" header and nav bar but the nav bar kept hiding behind the header.
On the contact.html I attempted to create a "box" effect for the the "leave a message" text box but it was not recognizing my code. Finally, on the portfolio section the <a> was processing only as the link and the website was giving an error that it is not prepared for live local upload. I omitted the pictures to keep the placeholders. 
I spent a lot of time on the github and ssh keys. Still having issues with uploading to github as it says I do not have access but it recognizes my username and email?!?
